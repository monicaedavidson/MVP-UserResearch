#Allergy Awareness List
#####Galen, Casey, Marissa and Monica
#####Define the MVP/User Research


###Background: 
- According to the CDC, 4-6% of US children are estimated to be aftected by food allergies. 
- Parents and guardians of these children need a list/app to give to caretakers (ie school, daycare, babysitters) that will notifiy them of food allergies. 
- Parents would like more avenues to communicate their children's food alergies.


###Objectives:
- We want to know how parents want to share information about their kid's allergies.


###Hypothesis:
- Parents would welcome a more direct and easy web-based method to share this information.


###Methods:
- Internet research on other allergy apps and anecdotal evidence from parents of kids with allergies.
- Work from Marissa's experience working as a graphic designer for Allermates, a Kid's allergy and health awareness products company.
- A call for interviews on social media and phonecalls to friends. Main questions:
  - What are the typical methods they use to inform people of their child's allergy?
  - Specifically what information concerning their kids' allergies they would like others to know?

###Reaching our MVP
- Who: Parents
- What: List of Child's Allergies
- Where: Web application, browser
- When: Planning for when others are looking after their children
- Why: To create awareness for children's allergies
- How: shareable list

###MVP
Based on the internet sources we've researched (see #Sources) and Marissa's anicdodal evidence, our minimal viable product is a very easy to share URL food allergy list. Current apps generally are scoped for personal use for elimination diets or seasonal allergies.

Parents of children with food allergies always want an easy and direct way to communicate their children's food allergies to people that will be looking after their children and preparing them food. We believe a convenient new tool would be a simple list accessed via URL they can share.

We will start by simply listing allergies, but will expand on this information (ie medicines, emergency contacts) based on feedback from our friend and social media interviews.
